<h3>Background</h3>
In 2015 Dr Colleen Henning arranged for Peter Bohacek to visit South Africa and
run workshops on Direct Measurement Videos. We used the visit as an opportunity
to run a conference and workshop in Johannesburg and Cape Town. To make the
event comprehensive we included a number of talks related to not only the
teaching of physics but also about education in general. There was overwhelming
feedback that it should be an annual event.


<h3>Goal</h3>
We want to bring together like-minded educators who want to be
part of building a strong community of practitioners that actively engage with
sharing ideas and learning more about physics research, how best to teach
physics, the impact of physics in society and the careers that are accessible
to physicists.</p>

<h3>2016 - Computational Physics</h3>
This year we have a more of a theme but have worked hard to keep the balance
between classroom-focused, hands-on workshops and more general talks.

Our theme, fear not <strong>NO programming experience</strong> required, is computational
physics. All of the speakers are passionate about physics education, not just
physics and the talks are aimed at high school teachers.

Computers are more than just fancy calculators, they are tools that are
becoming a fundamental part of doing physics - they enable physicists at all
levels to create, test and expore models; visualise systems and processes; and
solve problems that don't yet have analytical solutions.

Our line-up includes a hands-on workshop from Rhett Allain that will introduce
us to easy-to-use tools to bring computational physics and visualisations into
the classroom. 

We'll build on this with Trisha Salagaram talking about how
computational physics has become a pillar of modern physics and her work on
researching how it needs to be integrated into undergraduate physics. 

Then
we'll move beyond the school and university classrooms and learn about some
really exciting, cutting-edge research into galaxies that use computational
simulations from Romeel Davé. 

The skills that physicists learn covering
analytical-, quantitative- and technical skills are widely applicable and
Carolina Ödman-Govender will talk about how being a physicist is widely
applicable and enabled her to move out of academia into an exciting financial
technology company. 

Keeping up with the developments in Physics Education Research, like the
emphasis on the
integration of computational physics and visualisation, leads into the talk by
Saalih Allie on what other topics are emerging that in PER that we should be
aware of.

We'll wrap up with a summary of some of the more emergent techniques that are
being used in education by Megan Beckett but specifically integrated into the teaching
of electric circuits by Adam Reynolds.
